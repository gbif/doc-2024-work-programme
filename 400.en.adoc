== Priority Area 4: Infrastructure and data products

*_Maintain and evolve infrastructure to advance biodiversity-related knowledge_*

[[activity4-1]]
=== Activity 4.1: Enhance robustness of the core GBIF infrastructure

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* GBIF-maintained software and informatics infrastructure provides high, ongoing levels of availability and performance that keep pace with growth in data publication and use

==== Indicative tasks for 2024

* Retire the internal GBIF checklist database replace it with https://www.checklistbank.org/[ChecklistBank^], and deploy corresponding updates to public GBIF APIs
*	Maintain deployments of hosted portals and hosted data repositories (IPTs) 
*	Maintain GBIF R (https://www.gbif.org/tool/81747/[rgbif^]) and Python (https://www.gbif.org/tool/OlyoYyRbKCSCkMKIi4oIT/[pygbif^]) libraries to follow changes in GBIF public interfaces and support outcomes, including eDNA engagement activities
*	Mature deployment and operation of software on the Kubernetes technology platform 
*	Review and test disaster recovery processes
*	Plan capacity and hardware procurement to accommodate growth in volume and use of data 
*	Provide environments for development and network-wide testing, particularly related to indexing under revised data standards

** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: salaried staff; external contracts; core funding.

=== Activity 4.2: Enhance support services for data publishers and users

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* The expanding GBIF community of users are fully supported by a responsive help desk team and improved technical documentation
* The taxonomic and collections communities benefit from improvements in GBIF support to the https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll[Global Registry of Scientific Collections^] (GRSciColl) and the Catalogue of Life

==== Indicative tasks for 2024

* Establish ticketing system to manage, prioritize and monitor help desk support 
* Replace the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy with the extended Catalogue of Life, produced using ChecklistBank
* Support content curation on GRSciColl and coordinate editor and user communities as well as data import and synchronisation processes
* Upgrade documentation by
** Enhancing the understanding of data quality through consistent, accessible documentation of all related processes, tools and information products
** Revising the documentation on record-quality requirements, including occurrence id stability, and use of standardized values, including vocabularies
** Consolidating and expanding the technical documentation

** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: salaried staff; external contracts; core funding; supplementary funds `including special purpose fund`

=== Activity 4.3: Enhance features and capabilities of the GBIF infrastructure

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* Improved user interface to GBIF.org
* Improved capabilities for GBIF to handle ecological, collections, and phylogenetic data
* Data reuse increased through more stable GBIF identifiers

==== Indicative tasks for 2024

* Align interfaces, functionality and software used in GBIF.org, hosted portals, the shared data pipeline project and the Living Atlases 
* Improve ability for users to filter based on content types, including citizen science, eDNA and business sector
* Advance capabilities for event-based search based on prototype co-developed with the Atlas of Living Australia, and explore support for the forthcoming Humboldt core extension
* Implement a material catalogue to capture specimen information exposed in the new data model
* Enrich GRSciColl through integration of collection description information, compatible with the Latimer Core schema, to support use cases, including priority-setting for data mobilization and digitization
* Develop new data download formats that offer configurable summaries of occurrence data 
* Improve data quality by:
** Integrating basic data quality checks into the IPT and implementing emerging publishing models and changes to Darwin Core
** Continuing to explore approaches to annotation capabilities in GBIF.org focused on taxonomic and geographic combinations to detect suspicious records, piloting rule-based issue documentation with selected volunteer communities
** Maturing the workflows that ensure stable GBIF occurrence identifiers and improving communication about identified issues and solutions
* Explore alternative platforms and methods for integrating and managing information from literature tracking

** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: salaried staff; core funding; external contracts; supplementary funds: https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en[Horizon Europe^] (B-Cubed)

=== Activity 4.4: Drive data standards development

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* The revised GBIF data model is matured and applicable for use
* All controlled terms used in GBIF processing are managed in the vocabulary server

==== Indicative tasks for 2024

* Mature the unified data model
* â€¦

** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*:
