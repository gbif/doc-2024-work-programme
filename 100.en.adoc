[[activity1-1]]
=== Activity 1.1: Drive mobilization and use of biodiversity data to support priority thematic areas of relevance

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

*	Knowledge gaps are reduced by consolidating data coverage across the thematic areas of relevance
*	GBIF’s relevance to research is enhanced, through increased recognition and uptake of GBIF* mediated data among researchers across additional scientific disciplines

==== Indicative tasks for 2024

*	Commission an update to the systematic review of GBIF use in research (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2018093118[Heberling et al. 2020^]) to identify trends in research uses for the 2020-2024 periods, deepen the analysis of methods and analytical approaches, and inform future support for priority thematic areas of relevance
* Advance collaborative activities across new thematic areas of relevance based on recommendations from the Science Committee (currently identified as invasive alien species and agrobiodiversity) with support of identified experts in these areas
* Strengthen and expand support and guidance on mobilizing DNA-derived data from a range of data holder types and scales, supported by data quality improvements, improved coverage of DNA-detected organisms in the GBIF taxonomic backbone, and alignment of guidance with the new GBIF data model
* Expand data flows relating to vectors of human disease, in particular malaria-related data through GBIF partnership in the https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2022/04/inv021972[Vector Atlas^] project, with additional data streams on non-malaria vectors as recommended by the https://www.gbif.org/news/4jj1iKMn5llVnM6cUr8Y2m/[GBIF task group on vectors of human diseases^]

*** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: Salaried staff time apart from: external contract for systematic review update (core funds); possible external contracts for new thematic areas of relevance (core funds, possible supplementary funds); contract for expanding data flows on human disease vectors (supplementary funds: https://www.gatesfoundation.org/[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation^] through the Vector Atlas project)

[[activity1-2]]
=== Activity 1.2: Advance GBIF’s contribution to latest biodiversity modelling approaches

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* GBIF supports the evolution of fundamental data-driven biodiversity research and its application across methods, scales and disciplines in life and environmental sciences

==== Indicative tasks for 2024

* Consolidate prototype ‘digital twins’ dependent on and coordinated by GBIF through partnership on https://biodt.eu/[BioDT^], support user-group testing of prototype twins and links to key biodiversity data infrastructures, and build connections between projects and initiatives through shared data and service dependencies (such as https://pureportal.inbo.be/en/projects/b-cubed-biodiversity-building-blocks-for-policy[B-Cubed^])
* Improve GBIF’s capabilities to manage ecological data streams from key infrastructures and monitoring programmes, applying new data model to accommodate richer data (including absences based on complete species lists) while designing data flows and outputs in planned workshop on the https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/humboldt-extension/[TDWG Humboldt Extension^]

*** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: Salaried staff apart from: travel costs for Digital Twin activities (supplementary funds: https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en[Horizon Europe^(BioDT); workshop costs for managing ecological data streams (core funds, supplementary funds expected from https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/[Cornell Lab for Ornithology^] ) 

NOTE: Based on progress in 2023, The Secretariat proposes to conclude *Activity 1.3: Support open science principles* as a separate activity within <<priority1,Priority Area 1>>. Key milestones have been achieved through the recognition of GBIF as a Global Core Biodata Resource and the inclusion of GBIF in the list of core data infrastructures supporting the https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949.locale=en[UNESCO Open Science Recommendation^]. Follow-up on related tasks, such as engagement with UNESCO, OECD and implementation of CARE principles, will be redistributed under <<priority2>> and <<priority3>>.
