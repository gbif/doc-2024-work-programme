=== Activity 2.1: Support implementation of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

-	GBIF-mediated data is consistently and transparently applied and cited across multiple indicators used to monitor progress towards the goals and targets agreed through the https://www.cbd.int/[UN Convention on Biological Diversity^] (CBD)
-	GBIF is recognized as a key implementation partner for biodiversity-related projects supported by the https://www.thegef.org/[Global Environment Facility^] (GEF)
-	GBIF-mediated data is fully integrated into national https://www.cbd.int/chm/[Clearing-House Mechanism^] (CHM) platforms as well as national reporting processes for the CBD

==== Indicative tasks for 2024

- Work with partners to ensure that GBIF contributes efficiently and transparently to the finalized monitoring framework of the https://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-15/cop-15-dec-04-en.pdf[Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework^] (GBF), particularly headline indicators on invasive alien species (Target 6), business disclosures (Target 15) and availability of data, information and knowledge (Target 21)
*	Explore the potential of “data cube” delivery formats from GBIF to support further development of biodiversity indicators at national, regional and global levels
*	Implement the partnership agreement with https://www.geobon.org/[Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network^] (GEO BON), including joint promotion at CBD meetings, development of guidance for alignment of nodes and Biodiversity Observation Networks, and application of the new data model to support standardized observations
*	Support implementation of GBF Target 20 on capacity building and Target 21 on availability of data, information and knowledge through the [Biodiversity Information for Development^] (BID) programme, enhancing capacity in the mobilization and use of biodiversity data in developing countries (see <<activity3-4>>)
*	Consolidate GBIF’s position as a service provider for https://www.thegef.org/partners/gef-agencies[implementing agencies^] of the https://www.thegef.org/[Global Environment Fund^] (GEF)
*	Improve GBIF connections and explore partnerships with other biodiversity-related conventions, such as the https://www.cms.int/[Convention on Migratory Species^] (CMS), the https://cites.org/[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Fauna^] (CITES) and https://www.ramsar.org/[Ramsar Convention on Wetlands^], including through better coordination between GBIF nodes and national focal points

*** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: salaried staff; external contracts; non-salary expenses; core budget; supplementary funds: https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en[Horizon Europe^] (B-Cubed); https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/index_en[European Commission Directorate-General for International Partnerships^] (BID).

=== Activity 2.2: Support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

- GBIF’s value in supporting the https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/[UN Sustainable Development Goals^] (SDGs) is recognized and reinforced through strategic partnerships with relevant international organizations focused on climate change, food security, human health and well-being, and both terrestrial and marine biodiversity
- Relevance to multiple SDGs contributes to a broader funding base for GBIF both through project-based support and national contributions
- National contributions and project-based support provide a broader funding base that increases GBIF’s relevance to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and SDGs

==== Indicative tasks for 2024

- Consolidate formal partnerships with key agencies to support GBIF’s relevance to the SDGs, in particular with regard to human health, food security and climate change
-	Scope and commission an initial Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) report relating to GBIF’s operations policies, including but not restricted to gender/diversity guidelines, carbon and environmental footprints, and diversity and inclusion

*** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: salaried staff; external contracts; non-salary expenses; core funds; possible supplementary funds.

=== Activity 2.3: Support the science-policy interface

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

- GBIF’s role in providing data infrastructure essential to the work of the https://ipbes.net/[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services^] (IPBES) is fully recognized and communicated
-	GBIF’s use in policy and decision processes is enhanced through partnerships and better communicated

==== Indicative tasks for 2024



[[activity2-4]]
=== Activity 2.4: Support nature-positive outcomes from decisions in the business, financial and productive sectors

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

- Lending agreements prepared by financial institutions and public development banks include clear and unequivocal requirements for sharing biodiversity data
- Private companies, trade associations and consultancies in all global regions recognize GBIF as the preferred platform to share primary biodiversity data gathered through impact assessments and monitoring

==== Indicative tasks for 2024

- Consolidate and develop the Data4Nature initiative
